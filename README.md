# Personalized Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive and personalized data visualization system. The goal is to analyze, filter, and explore data dynamically using various import formats such as JSON, CSV, Excel, and APIs. The visualization will allow zooming, filtering, and pattern recognition, making it a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data science applications.

## Features
- **Multi-source Data Import:** Supports JSON, CSV, Excel, and API integration.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Zoom, filter, and dynamically adjust displayed data.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify trends and insights using customizable visual tools.
- **Customizable Dashboards:** Users can modify and personalize their data views.
- **Node.js Backend with Express:** Facilitates API interactions and data handling.
